On run the code file, i've already put the proper coordinates for people to understand quickly. for instance; √16+9 > 5 and √4+4+1 > 3.

On the image, i wanted people to understand 3 dimensional distance calculation that i've found from the source of https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/pythagoras-3d.html which explains the proccess a lot.

You can try to do your own distance calculation just by switching the numbers or do something that has something to do with getting input... your choice.


extra note: Alt+251 on the numpad returns "√"

Feel free to comment any issues that you may find in the code.
